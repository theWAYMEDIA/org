## About This Song

*[Placeholder: What is this song and when is it used? Who sings it and to whom? What is the occasion — gathering, hospice, ceremony, personal practice? What does it offer the listener or the recipient? Be specific about its purpose; songs have contexts. 2–4 paragraphs.]*

---

## Wayist Themes

*[Placeholder: For songs in English, this section replaces the word-by-word Meaning section used in mantra pages. Explain the Wayist concepts embedded in the lyrics — for a listener who does not know Wayism. Which specific teachings does the song carry? Tara? Soul evolution? The Butterfly Path? Sukhavati? Name each concept and explain it as it appears in the song. Use subheadings if there are several distinct themes.]*

*[Omit this section only if the song's Wayist content is already transparent to a general audience without explanation.]*

---

## Listen

*[Placeholder: List artists and note that recordings are available on major streaming platforms. If a specific label or licensing page exists, link to it. If only one artist, use the singular; if several, list them. For Podbean-only releases, replace this section with the Audio section from the mantra template.]*

## For Singers and Performers

*[Placeholder: What kind of singer or ensemble suits this song? What is the emotional and technical character required? Note tempo, dynamics, any section-specific guidance, and the performance context — bedside, gathering, recording, unaccompanied. Keep it practical.]*

## Further Reading

*[Placeholder: Link to the wayism.org pages for the theological concepts the song carries — soul evolution, Tara, the Butterfly Path, Sukhavati, practice, healing — wherever the reader can go deeper into what the song is pointing at.]*
