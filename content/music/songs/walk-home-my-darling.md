## About This Song

Walk Home My Darling is a song for the deathbed. It is sung by someone who loves a dying person — a spouse, a partner, a family member or close friend — as an act of blessing and release. It is also used by those who accompany the dying in a professional or community capacity: hospice workers, Wayist chaplains, community members who sit with the dying.

The song does not look away from what is happening. The journey here is ending. The beloved is leaving. It names this plainly, and then places it within the Wayist understanding of death: a transition, not an ending — and one the dying person does not walk into alone. Their Divine Tara is present, hand extended.

The singer's role is not to grieve in front of the dying person but to release them. *I will be alright, I promise.* That line carries the weight of the whole song: it frees the dying person from the worry of leaving. Singers who perform this well understand that the gift being given is permission to go.

The song belongs to the intimate genre sometimes called the farewell song or hospice hymn. In the Wayist tradition it is the most commonly used song at the bedside of the dying and in memorial gatherings. It is gentle enough to be hummed. It is honest enough to be believed.

## Wayist Themes

For listeners unfamiliar with Wayism, several images in the song carry specific meaning.

**The Divine Tara**
Each person has a Divine Tara — a personal guide who has walked the Butterfly Path before them and now accompanies them through this life and beyond. The Tara is not an angel in the traditional religious sense; they are a graduated spiritual being in the role of expert companion. At death, the Tara is present. The song reflects this literally: *Tara's waiting with hand extended / To walk you home today.* The bridge makes it vivid: *I can see Tara here beside you / Their light is filling up this room.* This is not metaphor in Wayism — it is described as observable by those with sufficient spiritual attunement.

**The Butterfly Path**
The Butterfly Path is the Wayist name for the journey of soul evolution — the long arc across many lifetimes through which a soul develops into an immortal spirit. The caterpillar-to-butterfly image is central: the caterpillar does not cease to exist when it becomes a butterfly; it transforms. Death is the cocoon stage — a transition from one form of existence to the next. *We built our wings together, darling / Now your wings are finally ready / To fly to that holy place.*

**Paradise and Sukhavati**
The song uses "Paradise" as a general term for the afterlife realm, but in Wayism these are two distinct places with different roles.

*Paradise* (Purusthana) is the intermediate soul heaven within the Psychomesion — the great realm between the material and spiritual domains. When a soul completes an incarnation, it goes to Paradise to rest, review the life just lived, integrate its wisdom, and eventually prepare for the next incarnation. This is where the reunion the singer promises actually takes place: *Until we walk together again / On the Butterfly Path in Paradise.* Both people will pass through Paradise between their lifetimes. Meeting there is real and expected.

*Sukhavati* — the Land of Pure Bliss — is further along. It is not a rest stop between lives but the graduation realm: where souls arrive after completing the Butterfly Path entirely, reborn as immortal spiritual beings in active cosmic service. Divine Taras live in Sukhavati. The Butterfly Path leads there, but most souls pass through Paradise many times on the way.

When the song says *On the Butterfly Path in Paradise*, it holds both meanings at once — the immediate comfort of reunion in Paradise, and the longer horizon of Sukhavati as the path's destination. For the dying person at the bedside, what matters is the nearer truth: they are not walking into emptiness. Paradise is real, their Tara is there, and the people they love will follow.

**Death as Graduation**
Wayism does not view death as punishment, failure, or loss for the one dying. Dying is completing a stage. The soul's wings are *finally ready*. The work of this life is done. This shifts the emotional register of the song from tragedy to a bittersweet completion — grief for the one left behind, but peace for the one departing.

## Lyrics

*Songwriter: Claudette Sky*

*Verse 1*

My love, your journey here is ending
The stars are calling you away
Tara's waiting with hand extended
To walk you home today
We walked together down this pathway
Caterpillar and butterfly, you and I
We laughed and cried and learned together
And our love will never die

*Chorus*

Walk home now, my beloved
Don't be afraid, you're not alone
Your Divine Tara is waiting
To walk you across the golden threshold home
I will be alright, I promise
Until we walk together again
On the Butterfly Path in Paradise
Where love has no end

*Verse 2*

Remember all our sunlit mornings?
The storms we weathered side by side?
Every joy and every sorrow
Was part of the sacred ride
We built our wings together, darling
With kindness, humility, and grace
Now your wings are finally ready
To fly to that holy place

*Chorus*

Walk home now, my beloved
Don't be afraid, you're not alone
Your Divine Tara is waiting
To walk you across the golden threshold home
I will be alright, I promise
Until we walk together again
On the Butterfly Path in Paradise
Where love has no end

*Bridge*

I can see Tara here beside you
Their light is filling up this room
They're taking your hand so gently
Healing every wound
This isn't goodbye, it's see you soon
In the garden where souls bloom
We'll meet again in Paradise
Where butterflies fill every room

*Final Verse — whispered*

Rest now, my precious darling
Close your eyes and find your peace
The pain is fading, light is calling
Tara brings you sweet release

*Outro — very soft*

Fly now... my love... fly...
Your Tara... walks you home...
Until we... meet again...
In peace... in light... in love...

*"I love you... always..."*

*(humming, then silence)*

## For Singers and Performers

This song is typically performed by lounge singers — those who can hold an intimate, unhurried presence and sing as if speaking directly to one person. The qualities that make a lounge singer suited to this song are exactly the qualities the song requires: warmth without performance, restraint, complete attention on the listener.

**Character:** This is not a concert piece. It is not sung to an audience — it is sung to a person. The singer who forgets this will get the tone wrong. Even in a recording, the best versions sound like they were sung in a room with one other person in it.

**Tempo:** Very slow — around 45 to 55 BPM, described in the original production notes as *like a slow heartbeat gradually stilling*. There is no rush in this song. Rushing would break the spell.

**Dynamics:** The song moves progressively inward. Verse 1 is tender but present. The chorus has a quiet openness to it. The bridge is witnessing — almost outside itself, describing what is being seen. The final verse drops to a whisper. The outro is barely voiced. Silence at the end is part of the performance.

**The chorus line:** *I will be alright, I promise* — this is the emotional center of the song. Sing it with conviction, not sorrow. It is a gift, not a lament.

**At the bedside:** If singing live in a hospice or home setting, a single voice with gentle acoustic guitar or unaccompanied is most appropriate. Soft strings can support without crowding. The outro can be hummed rather than sung if words feel like too much.
