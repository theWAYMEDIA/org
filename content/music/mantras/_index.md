## What Is a Mantra?

A mantra is a short sacred formula — a phrase, syllable, or sequence of sounds — used as the focus of meditative repetition. The word comes from Sanskrit: *man* (mind) and *tra* (tool or instrument). A mantra is literally a mind-tool.

In Wayist practice, mantras serve a straightforward function: they give the wandering attention something worthy to return to. The mantra is not the goal — it is the anchor. While the soul-minds go about their restless business, the spirit-minds can maintain quiet connection with the Divine through the thread of repeated sacred sound.

Mantras in the Wayist canon draw from the long inheritance of DaoFa, Mahamarga, and related streams. Many are in Sanskrit or Pali. Some are in Chinese or other languages of the ancient Wayist world. A few are in contemporary English for practitioners whose contemplative language is English.

## How to Use Mantras

**Formal sitting practice:** Choose one mantra. Sit quietly. Repeat the mantra silently or aloud, returning attention to it each time the mind wanders. Duration matters less than regularity.

**Attitude of Meditation:** A short mantra can run as a quiet background thread through ordinary daily activity — washing dishes, walking, waiting. This is the *attitude* of meditation: continuous low-level attentiveness rather than discrete formal sessions.

**Dayspring Ritual:** Some practitioners incorporate a mantra into the daily Dayspring Ritual, adding voiced repetition to the water-and-intention practice that unites Wayists worldwide each morning.

Repetition is not the purpose — attention is. The mantra is the vehicle, not the destination.
