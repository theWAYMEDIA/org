## Teaching Notes

The Om Mārgi Divya Sodhana is a healing mantra in the Wayist tradition. Its name states its purpose plainly: *divya* (divine) *sodhana* (purification, cleansing). The prefix *Mārgi* — "of the Path," from *mārga* — identifies it as a Wayist composition, distinguishing it from the broader Sanskrit mantra corpus.

The mantra works through three movements: light flowing through breath, affliction released through the heart, and divine power drawn down from the celestial realm. These correspond naturally to the three domains recognized in Wayism — the material (breath, body), the soul (heart, emotional reality), and the spirit (divine power from above). It is not a mantra about escaping difficulty but about moving it through, with divine assistance.

It is suited to any practitioner. Those going through illness, grief, or sustained difficulty may find it particularly direct. It can also serve as a support practice for those doing healing work with others.

**Tradition:** Wayist Traditional
**Practice context:** Healing practice; sitting meditation; support for illness or difficulty
**Suitable for:** All practitioners

## Meaning

The mantra consists of three lines, each addressing one movement of the purification:

**Om jyotiḥ prāṇena vahati**

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Om | The primordial sacred syllable; the sound of theWAY itself |
| jyotiḥ | light, radiance |
| prāṇena | through breath, through life force (*prāṇa* = breath/vital energy) |
| vahati | flows, carries, bears |

*"Om — light flows through breath."*

Breath is the vehicle of life force. The opening line grounds the mantra in the body: healing begins with breath, with prāṇa, with what is immediate and available right now.

---

**Rogaṃ hṛdayena śodhyate**

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| rogaṃ | disease, illness, affliction (accusative — the thing acted upon) |
| hṛdayena | through the heart, by the heart |
| śodhyate | is purified, is cleansed (passive — it is done *to* the affliction) |

*"Affliction is purified through the heart."*

The cleansing is not willed or forced — *śodhyate* is passive voice. The heart is not the agent; it is the channel. This is consistent with Wayist understanding: the soul-mind of the heart does not manufacture healing, it allows it.

**Divya śaktiḥ pravartatā svaḥ**

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| divya | divine, heavenly |
| śaktiḥ | power, energy |
| pravartatā | flows forth, proceeds, arises — read here as invocatory: *let it flow* |
| svaḥ | the celestial realm, heaven (one of the Vedic *vyāhṛti*: bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ) |

*"Divine power — flow forth from heaven."*

The third line shifts register: where the first two lines describe what happens, this line invokes it. It is a call directed upward and outward — to the spirit domain, to the Divine, to whatever stands in the healing role for this person. In Wayist understanding, that is one's Divine Tara.

The closing *svaḥ* is not the familiar ritual exclamation *svāhā* but the Vedic utterance for the celestial realm — a precise word pointing to where healing power originates.

## How to Recite This Mantra

The mantra has three lines and is traditionally recited six complete times, followed by a single sustained *Om* held as long as comfortable. The full recitation takes only a few minutes.

**Pace:** Steady and unhurried. Allow a natural breath between each full recitation if needed.

**Voice:** Recite aloud when possible — the sound of the words is part of the practice. Silent recitation is suitable when circumstances require it.

**Attention:** On the first line, notice the breath. On the second line, rest attention in the chest. On the third line, open attention upward — do not strain at this; simply allow it.

**Repetition:** Six repetitions is the traditional count for this mantra. As with any mantra, consistency over time matters more than duration in a single session.

**In healing contexts:** The mantra may be recited by the person in difficulty, by someone supporting them, or by both together. It is not a replacement for medical care.
