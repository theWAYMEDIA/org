# Who Is Jesus in Wayism?

## The Foundation Problem

**Christianity teaches Jesus as exclusive divine savior requiring belief for salvation, while simultaneously obscuring his original teaching of The Way through theological overlay and mistranslation** that serves institutional control rather than spiritual development. This creates a double barrier: you must believe specific doctrines about Jesus's identity while being prevented from understanding what he actually taught.

## The Discovery Process (Jesus Understanding Recognition)

**Teaching vs. Theology Recognition:** *"When you read Jesus's actual words - 'walk as I walk,' 'be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect,' 'the kingdom of God is within you' - do these sound like someone asking for belief about his identity, or someone teaching a path of transformation?"*

**Historical Context Examination:** *"Jesus was Jewish, taught in Aramaic, and his followers were called 'People of The Way' for decades before 'Christianity' emerged. What might his teaching have been before Greek philosophy and Roman politics shaped it into a religion about him rather than a path taught by him?"*

**Translation Honesty Assessment:** *"When you learn that ancient Greek manuscripts had no capital letters to distinguish 'son of God' from 'Son of God,' or 'holy spirit' from 'Holy Spirit,' how does that change your understanding of theological claims built entirely on those capitalizations?"*

## The Wayist Foundation (Jesus as Avalokiteshvara Incarnate)

### Quick Answer (30 seconds)

**Jesus (called 'Lord Jesus' as honorific) was an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, a senior spiritual being from Sukhavati Heaven who incarnated to restore The Way teaching.** He taught transformation through living wisdom, not salvation through believing doctrines about him. Wayism honors his actual teaching while distinguishing it from later Christian theological overlay that serves institutional purposes.

### Understanding Jesus's True Identity

**Primary Recognition:** Jesus was not the founder of Christianity - he was a teacher of The Way, an ancient path of soul transformation that existed centuries before him and continues today through Wayism.

**The Incarnation Pattern:**
Throughout history, when The Way teaching becomes diluted or warped through globalization, empire, and adaptation to ruling class designs, Heaven sometimes sends senior spiritual beings to incarnate and restore the original teaching. 

**Avalokiteshvara's Role:**
- **Senior spiritual being** in Sukhavati Heaven (the realm of graduated spirits)
- **Known for compassion and sacrifice** to make possible the graduation of all souls on the Butterfly Path
- **Called "Saviour of the World"** (this title predates Christianity by hundreds of years in Buddhist texts)
- **Has incarnated multiple times** to restore The Way teaching when needed

**Jesus as Restoration Teacher:**
Lord Krishna and Lord Jesus are recognized as the two most prominent incarnations of Avalokiteshvara in our historical era, each restoring The Way teaching in their respective cultural contexts.

## What "Lord Jesus" Means

### The Honorific Explained

**"Lord" is respectful title, not worship claim:**
- In English, "Lord" is an honorific showing respect (like "Sir" or "Your Honor")
- Spanish "Señor Jesus" the building contractor becomes "Lord Jesus" if he becomes a magistrate in London
- The title distinguishes respectful reference without making exclusive divine claims
- Christians use "Christ" as their honorific; Wayists use "Lord" or "Buddha Jesus" (meaning "Wise One Jesus")

**Why This Matters:**
The honorific clarifies we respect Jesus as teacher and incarnate spiritual being without accepting later theological claims about exclusive divinity or required belief in him for salvation.

## Jesus's Actual Teaching vs. Christian Theology

### What Jesus Taught

**The Way of Transformation:**
Jesus taught the same ancient path found in:
- Jewish mysticism through Melchizedek's teaching (reflected in Isaiah 35:8: "There will be a highway called the Way of Holiness")
- Chinese Daoism (The Way / Dao)
- Indian Mahamarga (The Great Path)

**Core Message - Walking, Not Believing:**
- "I am the Way, and the truth, and the life" - speaking of the path he embodies, not worship of his person
- "No one comes to the Father except through me" - meaning through this path of transformation (there is only ONE path to soul metamorphosis into spirit)
- "Follow me" meant walk as I walk, live as I live - not believe doctrines about my identity
- He advocated a way of being, not a faith requiring intellectual assent

**The Transformation Teaching:**
Jesus taught the Butterfly Path - that humans are souls being educated through physical incarnation to eventually metamorphose into immortal spiritual beings (graduating to become "children of God the Father and God the Mother" in Sukhavati Heaven).

### What Christianity Created

**Theological Overlay Developed Later:**
- Greek philosophical concepts (Trinity, hypostatic union)
- Roman organizational structures and control mechanisms
- Exclusive salvation claims requiring belief in specific doctrines
- Worship of Jesus's person rather than walking his path
- Mistranslations and capital letter insertions to create theological meanings not in original texts

**The Honest Reality:**
Just as people today put words in Buddha's mouth or claim to channel ancient teachers, the Christian Bible contains adapted and invented teachings attributed to Jesus that serve institutional purposes rather than representing his actual words.

## Jesus and "Son of God"

### Understanding the Original Meaning

**The Translation Problem:**
Ancient Greek manuscripts were written in all capitals with no spaces between words - there was no way to distinguish "son of god" from "Son of God." Later translators added capitalization to inject theological claims that weren't in the original text.

**The Jewish Context:**
Psalm 82:6 states: "I said, 'You are gods; you are all sons of the Most High.'" This reflects ancient Wayist understanding that came through Melchizedek to Jewish mystical tradition - we are ALL children of God, developing toward spiritual maturity.

**Jesus's Teaching:**
When Jesus spoke of being "son of God," he taught that we are all children of our Father in Heaven. The exclusive "Son of God" title is a later Christian invention that contradicts his actual teaching about universal divine parentage.

**The Anahata Teaching:**
Jesus taught about the seed of spirit from God the Father nurtured by God our Mother in Heaven. Through the Butterfly Path, we metamorphose from soul-beings into spiritual beings - complete transformation like caterpillar to butterfly. In this sense, graduated spirits are truly "children" (offspring) of the divine parents in Heaven.

## The "Only Begotten Son" Claim

### Where This Teaching Originated

**Not Jesus's Teaching:**
This is much later Christian theology that does not apply to People of The Way or Wayism.

**The Possible Source:**
The Lotus Sutra (predating Christianity by hundreds of years) explains that Avalokiteshvara and his sister Prajnaparamita were the first spirit beings created by Amitabha (God the Father) and PandaraJanani (God the Mother) when they established Sukhavati Heaven.

**"Begotten" Context:**
Because they were created directly by the deities rather than through soul-to-spirit evolution, they are described as "begotten" - meaning unborn, not the result of biological procreation or educational graduation.

**The Misunderstanding:**
Christianity likely encountered this teaching and misapplied it, creating exclusive claims about Jesus that contradict both his original teaching and the broader spiritual reality of many graduated spirits in Heaven.

## Jesus as "Saviour of the World"

### The Ancient Title

**Buddhist Teaching Predating Christianity:**
The Lotus Sutra (written centuries before Christianity) describes Avalokiteshvara as "Saviour of the World" because of his compassion and sacrifices to make possible the graduation of all souls on the Butterfly Path.

**Chinese Adaptation:**
When China incorporated Avalokiteshvara in female form as Guanyin, the title "Saviour of the World through compassion and sacrifice" became central to understanding this spiritual being's role.

**Wayist Understanding:**
Jesus, as an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, does indeed serve as world saviour - but not through requiring belief in him. Rather, through teaching and demonstrating the path of transformation that makes spiritual graduation possible for all souls.

**The Distinction:**
- **Christian claim:** Believe in Jesus or face eternal damnation
- **Wayist reality:** Follow the path Jesus taught (The Way) to develop toward spiritual graduation

## Why This Matters for Your Journey

### For Ex-Christians Exploring Wayism

**You're Not Betraying Jesus:**
You're actually honoring him more authentically by seeking his original teaching rather than accepting theological overlay that obscures what he taught.

**The Way Existed Before Jesus:**
Jesus didn't create a new religion - he restored an ancient path. You're connecting with something older and more authentic than Christianity.

**Jesus Would Recognize This Teaching:**
The Wayist framework of soul development, karma as curriculum, Divine Tara guidance, and metamorphosis into spiritual beings matches what Jesus taught about the kingdom within, perfection development, and becoming children of God.

**Liberation from Theological Confusion:**
Understanding Jesus as Avalokiteshvara incarnate frees you from contradictory doctrines while allowing genuine respect for his teaching and mission.

### Common Transition Challenges

**Guilt About Questioning:**
If Jesus taught truth, then honest seeking of truth honors him. If theology about Jesus requires you to stop seeking truth, that theology serves institutional control, not spiritual development.

**Fear of Divine Punishment:**
Jesus taught about a loving Father in Heaven who guides soul development, not a deity who tortures people eternally for intellectual doubt. That fear was installed by institutions, not by Jesus.

**Attachment to Community Identity:**
Your spiritual development matters more than maintaining religious identity that prevents growth. Jesus consistently chose truth over religious institutional approval.

**Family Pressure:**
Remember that Jesus also faced family opposition when he chose authentic spiritual teaching over conventional religious conformity (Mark 3:21, 31-35).

## Integration Practices

### Distinguishing Jesus from Christianity

**When Reading Gospel Texts:**
- Notice when Jesus teaches transformation ("be perfect," "be born again," "the kingdom is within")
- Distinguish his words from theological interpretations added by gospel writers
- Ask: "Is this about walking a path or believing a doctrine?"
- Compare with ancient Way teachings from other cultures

### Honoring Jesus Appropriately

**Respectful Recognition:**
- Honor him as advanced teacher and incarnate spiritual being
- Study his actual teaching about The Way
- Walk the path he taught rather than worshiping his person
- Recognize him as one of several great Way teachers throughout history

**Avoiding New Idolatry:**
- Don't replace Christian worship with New Age romanticization
- Keep focus on the teaching, not the teacher's personality
- Remember: he pointed to the path, not to himself
- The goal is your development, not devotion to any teacher

### Living The Way Jesus Taught

**Daily Practice Focus:**
- Develop compassion and wisdom (his core teachings)
- Practice service to others (his demonstration)
- Work on inner transformation (his central message)
- Connect with Divine Tara guidance (his "holy spirit" teaching)
- Progress on Butterfly Path toward spiritual graduation

## Common Follow-Up Questions

**Q: If Jesus was just a teacher, why did he perform miracles?**
A: Graduated spiritual beings incarnating from Sukhavati Heaven often demonstrate advanced spiritual capacities. This doesn't make Jesus exclusively divine - many realized beings throughout history have demonstrated similar abilities.

**Q: What about Jesus's death and resurrection?**
A: His death demonstrated commitment to truth despite institutional opposition. His post-death appearances demonstrate soul continuation after physical death - a teaching he emphasized about everyone, not just himself. Christianity made his experience exclusive when he taught it was universal.

**Q: Can I still pray to Jesus?**
A: You can certainly honor and learn from Jesus, but understand that graduated spiritual beings in Heaven (including Avalokiteshvara/Jesus) aren't personal servants responding to requests. Better to develop your Divine Tara connection (your personal spiritual guide) as Jesus taught.

**Q: Does Wayism reject everything Christian?**
A: Wayism rejects theological overlay and institutional distortion while honoring Jesus's original teaching of The Way. Much authentic wisdom remains in Christianity, buried under doctrinal claims and mistranslation.

*Jesus taught a path of transformation, not a religion of belief. Understanding him as Avalokiteshvara incarnate restores his original teaching while freeing you from theological confusion that prevents authentic spiritual development.*

**Remember:** The greatest honor you can give Jesus is to actually walk the path he taught rather than merely believing doctrines about his identity. That's what "following Jesus" originally meant - and that's what Wayism continues.
